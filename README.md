# Disease simulator

Try changing social distance during the course of a disease by using history navigation and observe the effects on the total infected, peak infected, and length of disease existence.

## Assumptions and simplifications
* Each infected person transmits to exactly R<sub>0</sub> others over the course of their sickness in the absence of social distance.
* Every infected person takes the same amount of time to recover and become non-contagious.
* Each infected person can transmit to any other person. Not realistic because people only infect those who are near them. However, it is made more realistic by travel.
* Every person socially behaves the same way.
* No one dies.
